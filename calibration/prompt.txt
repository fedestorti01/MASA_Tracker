Create an application using opencv to display to 2 images next to each other. The images should be as large as possible (use all the window).
However the must divide the screen in two exact halves.
I can select mathcing points on the two images, by clicking one point in the first image and one point on the other images. These two points become a pair.
In the bottom there are buttons to control the application:
1. load the image on the first panel
2. load the image ont on the second panel
3. add/create matching points
4. finish and export the matching points


Add another button to compute the homography between the two  set of points. 
Refer to file findHomography.py lines 164-190.
Once the homograpgy has been computed. Moving the mouse on the first image, I see the associated point on the second image.
refer to file findHomography.py lines 20-50
